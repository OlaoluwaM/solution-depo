# A Collection of solutions to coding problems

Here I store solutions about to problems I come across online. Anyone is free to
add their own solutions, to any of these problem, or any other that isn't in the
repository. However if you wish to do so, I only ask that the name of the
solution file reflects the name of the problem for easy reference for others.

You can find more problems like these to solve at
