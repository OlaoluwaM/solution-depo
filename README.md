# A Collection of solutions to coding problems

Here I store solutions about to problems I come across online. Anyone is free to
add one of their solutions, to one of these problem, or any other they have come
across. However if you wish to do so, I only ask that the name of the solution
file reflects the name of the problem for easy reference for others.
